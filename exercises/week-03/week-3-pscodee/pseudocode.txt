-Visualize-
1. Walkingspeed : 1 min F, 2 min M, 4 min S, 5 min D
2. 1 torch = for max. 12. min
3. max 2 people through the tunnel

-Plan and divide-
--- Time is limited.
We can choose the fastest and slowest people together to reduce the time.

-Pseudo code-
Initialize maxTime as 12;
Initialize totalTime as 0;
Initialize maxPeople as 2;
Initialize PeopleAtStart as 4;

Select 2FastestPeople;
Select 2SlowestPeople;

ControlStep: is only working if we call it.
  IF NOT totalTime <= maxTime and NumberofPeople <= maxPeople
    Print "Failure. Try again."
  ELSE
    IF PeopleAtStart != 0
    Go next Step  
  END IF
 

 STEP 1
    Go 2FastestPeople 
    ADD totalTime = totalTime + Speed of 2FastestPeople
    SET PeopleAtStart = PeopleAtStart - 2FastestPeople
    Call ControlStep

STEP 2 
    the fastest is going to back 
    ADD totalTime = totalTime + Speed of the fastest people
    SET PeopleAtStart =  PeopleAtStart + 
    Call ControlStep

STEP 3
    Go 2SlowestPeople
    ADD totalTime = totalTime + Speed of the  2SlowestPeople
    SET NumberofPeople = Number of people in 2SlowestPeople

STEP 4
    Back the fastest people 
    ADD totalTime = totalTime + Speed of the  fastest people
    SET NumberofPeople = Number of people in fastest people

STEP 5
    Go 2FastestPeople
    ADD totalTime = totalTime + Speed of the  2FastestPeople
    SET NumberofPeople = Number of people in 2FastestPeople

STEP 6
If total time <= maxTime and PeopleAtStart = 0 print "SUCCESS. You rule !"
ELSE print "FAILED. Try again !"

--- Darkness phoebia ---
One family wants to get through a tunnel. Dad can make it in 1 minute, mama in 2 minutes, son in 4 and daughter in 5 minutes. Unfortunately, not more than two persons can go through the narrow tunnel at one time, moving at the speed of the slower one.
Can they all make it to the other side if they have a torch that lasts only 12 minutes and they are afraid of the dark?
--- Limits ---
1. Walkingspeed : 1 min F, 2 min M, 4 min S, 5 min D
2. 1 torch = for max. 12. min
3. max 2 people through the tunnel
